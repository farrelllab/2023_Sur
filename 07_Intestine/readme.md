# Zebrafish endoderm atlas - pneumatic duct, *best4*+ enterocytes and posterior lysosome-rich enterocytes

This folder contains the code that was used to perform focused analysis on the endodermal derivatives containing 12,592 cells. The files enlisted here includes the code for:
1. Analyzing the endoderm atlas and identifying transcriptionally distinct subpopulations. The atlas captured major endodermal populations including the liver, intestine, exocrine pancreas, endocrine pancreas, pharynx, esophagus, pneumatic-duct and several distinct progenitor populations.
2. Differential expression analysis of the pneumatic duct subpopulation compared to all other endodermal derivatives. 
3. Differential expression analysis of *best4*+ enterocytes compared to all other intestinal cell types. 
4. Comparative analysis of gene expression in *best4*+ enterocytes between the zebrafish intestine (this dataset) versus previously published scRNAseq datasets from the human colon (Parikh et al., 2019) and small-intestine (Burclaff et al., 2022).
5. Reconstruction of URD trajectories for intestinal derivatives including non-canonical populations such as *best4*+ enterocytes and lysosome-rich enterocytes. 
6. Visualizing the intestinal URD trajectory as a force-directed layout. 
7. Elucidating the temporal dynamics of gene expression along the *best4*+ enterocytes and lysosome-rich enterocyte branch using impulse response fitting over pseudotime. 

The code contained in this folder was used to generate the following figure panels: Figure 6A-C, F-G; Figure 7A-F, I; Figure S8A-B; Figure S9; Figure S10.
