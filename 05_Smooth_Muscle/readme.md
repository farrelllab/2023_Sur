# Non-skeletal muscle atlas, pericyte subtypes and intestinal SMCs

This folder contains the code that was used to generate: 
1. The non-skeletal muscle atlas comprising 3866 cells (that includes pericytes and smooth muscle cells) and 24 distinct clusters using Seurat v4.1.0
2. Simulated pericyte related artificial doublets to exclude the possibility that the distinct pericyte populations may be artefacts of single-cell dissociation
3. URD trajectories and force-directed layout of the non-neural crest derived smooth muscle populations and myofibroblasts using URD v1.1.2.
4. Gene expression cascades calculated along the trajectories to circular and longitudinal intestinal smooth muscles using URD v1.1.2.

The files in this folder contains code that was used to generate the figure panels in the following figures: Figure 3A-D, H, L; Figure 4A, B, N, O; Figure S5A-C; Figure S6A, C, E; Figure S7A, B; Figure S8I-K; and Figure S9.
