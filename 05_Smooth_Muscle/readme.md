# Non-skeletal muscle atlas, pericyte subtypes and intestinal SMCs

This folder contains the code that was used to perform focused analysis on the non-skeletal muscle subset that contained 3866 cells. This atlas contained involuntary muscles such as cardiac muscles, smooth muscles (vascular and visceral), and other perivascular cell types such as pericytes and myofibroblasts. The files in this folder contains code for: 
1. Analyzing the non-skeletal muscle atlas to further characterize transcriptionally distinct pericyte and smooth muscle subpopulations. 
2. Comparative gene expression analysis of three pericyte subtypes as well as vascular and visceral smooth muscle subtypes. 
3. Simulation of pericyte related artificial doublets to exclude the possibility that the distinct pericyte populations may be artefacts of single-cell dissociation.
4. Reconstruction of URD trajectories for the non-neural crest derived smooth muscle (intestinal and vascular) populations and myofibroblasts
5. Visualization of the smooth  muscle trajectory as a force-directed layout.  
6. Gene expression cascades calculated along the trajectories to circular and longitudinal intestinal smooth muscles revealing differential transcription factors underlying the specification of the intestinal smooth muscles.

The files in this folder contains code that was used to generate the figure panels in the following figures: Figure 3A-D, H, L; Figure 4A-B, N, O; Figure S5A-C; Figure S6A, C, E; Figure S7A, B; Figure S8I-K; and Figure S9.
