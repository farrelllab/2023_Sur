# Gene expression statistics

This code was designed to inspect genes across our data to determine how many expressed genes were captured in this data set, whether they varied across cell types, whether they varied across time, and whether genes with less evidence (such as computationally predicted genes or cDNA clones) had different expression parameters compared to 'named' genes.

Files contained in this folder contains code that was used to generate the following figures: Figure 1D-F, and Figure S1I-K.
